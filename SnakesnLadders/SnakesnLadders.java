Write a Java program to simulate a game of Snakes and Ladders.
If you have not played the game before then you should read 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snakes_and_Ladders

Game Rules:

1. Need a board with numbers from 1 to 100 with 5 to 7 snakes and 5 to 7 ladders.
2. Two or more players.
3. A fair Dice that randomly gives a number between 1 to 6 (inclusive).
4. A player begins at position 0 and moves to the next position based on the outcome of the dice.
5. If the new position is a ladder the player progresses to the next higher position indicated by the ladder.
6. If the new position is a snake the player goes down to the lower position indicated by the snake.
7. The next player takes turn and goes through the steps 3 to 6.
8. The game is played until one of the players reach the position 100.
